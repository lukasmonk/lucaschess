Rodent III is an open source chess engine by Pawel Koziol, licensed under GPL 3.0. 
It is based on a much weaker engine Sungorus 1.4 by Pablo Vazquez.  It is designed 
to allow the user to vary its playing strength and characteristics by seting a wide 
variety of variables affecting the engine's play.  These can also be pre-set by the 
user through the use of a number of personality files.

Rodent III is a UCI protocol compliant chess engine.  It is operated through a command 
line interface.  If the user wants to have a graphical user interface, Rodent III can be 
used with chess GUI programs such as Arena, ChessGUI, TarraschGUI, Winboard (which also 
has excellent UCI support) or other UCI compliant chess GUI program.

For the further information Rodent III playing styles see the rodent documents.
