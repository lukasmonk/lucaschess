How should I set the hash table size?

=====================================



In general the default hash table size setting in Komodo will work

well for you.  However, if you want optimal performance you may wish

to tweak this value.  We are providing some guidelines here.



The optimal hash table size setting for Komodo is when the program

utilizes half, or less, of the hash table.  When the percentage

exceeds 50% you will see a decline in performance.



In modern chess programs the hash tables can fill very quickly, so it

may not be possible to provide the optimal hash table size, especially

when doing deep searches or using the program for deep analysis or

where the amount of memory on a given machine is limited.  So the rule

of thumb in these cases is to set the hash table size as large as

reasonable possible without sacrificing too much system performance.

Keep in mind that very heavy memory usage can impact the speed of the

program and the underlying operating system.



We have devised a general rule of thumb for determining how large to

set the hash table based on the time control you wish to play.



We consider sudden death or Fischer time controls but these guidelines

can be extrapolated to other time controls.  There are system

considerations too so this is not a hard rule but really just a

general guideline and does not take into consideration the memory

caching performance of your machine.  Nevertheless, most modern PC's

will do well with these settings:



  1. Take the main time in minutes and add the increment in seconds

     (for sudden death the increment is zero.)



  2. Multiply the value obtained in step 1 by 3.



  3. From the opening position, do a fixed time search of exactly this

     amount of time in seconds.



  4. Note the hash table utilization as reported by the GUI.  



  5. If the hash table utilization is much above 40%,  double the hash

     table size and repeat this test.



  6. If the hash table utilization is too small, for example well

     below 20%, you are probably setting your table higher than it

     needs to be.  



For technical reasons, setting a hash table that is much larger than

it needs to be will have a negative impact on the performance of your

chess program (and the rest of the system) as it place more demands on

the memory sub-system and cache.  However the impact is generally

pretty minor up to about half of the total RAM on your system. Going beyond 

that is risky. In general, all other things being equal, you should err 

on the side of being too large rather than being too small, as long as 

you don't exceed half of total memory.  We generally suggest choosing 

the smallest hash table size that gives no more than about 40% utilization 

using this test.
